## Features

- Execute multiple shell scripts on multiple remote hosts via SSH
- No complex configs, no intricate YAML, no DSLs - just plain shell and a single binary
- Concurrent execution with worker limits
- Structured logging
- Secure authentication using SSH private keys
- Automatic script upload and execution
- Summary table of execution results

---

## Installation

1. Download the latest binary for your platform from
   the [Releases page](https://github.com/hashmap-kz/rconf/releases).
2. Place the binary in your system's `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`).

### Example installation script for Unix-Based OS _(requirements: tar, curl, jq)_:

```bash
(
set -euo pipefail

OS="$(uname | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
ARCH="$(uname -m | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/' -e 's/\(arm\)\(64\)\?.*/\1\2/' -e 's/aarch64$/arm64/')"
TAG="$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/hashmap-kz/rconf/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)"

curl -L "https://github.com/hashmap-kz/rconf/releases/download/${TAG}/rconf_${TAG}_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz" |
tar -xzf - -C /usr/local/bin && \
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rconf
)
```

---

## Usage

```sh
rconf \
  --pkey /path/to/private_key \
  --filename /path/to/script1.sh,/path/to/script-dir/ \
  --filename https://shared.company.com/path/to/script.sh \
  --conn backup@10.40.240.193 \
  --conn myuser@10.40.240.189:2222 \
  --workers 5 \
  --log execution.log
```

### Flags

| Flag          | Short | Description                                                               |
|---------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--pkey`      | `-i`  | Path to SSH private key (required)                                        |
| `--pkey-pass` |       | Passphrase to SSH private key (required when pkey is password-protected)  |
| `--filename`  | `-f`  | Comma-separated list of script paths or directories (required)            |
| `--conn`      | `-H`  | Comma-separated list of remote hosts (required).                          |
|               |       | Format: username:password@host:port                                       |
|               |       | Password and Port are optional                                            |
| `--recursive` | `-R`  | "Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively (default: true) |
| `--workers`   | `-w`  | Maximum concurrent SSH connections (default: 2)                           |
| `--log`       | `-l`  | Log file path (default: `ssh_execution.log`)                              |

## How It Works

1. The tool reads the provided scripts into memory.
2. It establishes SSH and SFTP connections to each host.
3. The scripts are uploaded to the remote host's `/tmp/` directory.
4. The scripts are executed remotely using `sudo`.
5. Execution results are stored and displayed in a summary table.
